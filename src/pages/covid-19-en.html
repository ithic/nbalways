    <h1>COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Tourism Updates and Resources</h1>

    <p>Last updated: May 19, 2020</p>

    <p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is leading national efforts to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) and working with the World Health Organization and other international partners. The Public Health Agency of New Brunswick is closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in the province.</p>

    <p>This is a rapidly evolving situation and updated information and guidance will be provided on the Public Health Agency of New Brunswick’s web site as it becomes available.</p>

    <p>We are in close communication with Destination Canada, our in-market representatives, and industry partners to ensure a coordinated response to tourism impacts. We will follow the lead of public health experts and are prepared to adjust our marketing strategies and programming as required.</p>

    <p>Our partners at the Tourism Industry Association of New Brunswick (TIANB) have established a support line (phone and/or video) for tourism operators and staff during the COVID-19 crisis. Their bilingual team will help you understand the federal and provincial programs available to you and what you qualify for. The support also includes understanding the application process as well what you will need to apply. Please call 1-833-50TIANB (1-833-508-4262) between 8:30 am and 6 pm Monday through Friday. </p>

    <p>We are committed to keeping our tourism industry updated via this page as new information becomes available.</p>
