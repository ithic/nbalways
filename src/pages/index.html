  <h2 class="sans-serif"><strong>Sights and Sounds of New Brunswick</strong></h2>
  <p class="sans-serif small">Here’s a little taste of New Brunswick to enjoy from wherever you might be. Kick back and relax to the soothing sounds of the Mirimichi, take in a sunset at Beaubears Island, or watch all kinds of fish go about their day at the Huntsman Fundy Discovery Aquarium. If you think these are great, wait until you experience it all in person.</p>
